# graphql-api-koa changelog

## 2.0.0

### Major

- Errors thrown in resolvers without an `expose: true` property have their message masked by `Internal Server Error` in the response body to prevent client exposure. Koa app listeners and middleware still have access to the original errors.

## 1.1.2

### Patch

- Fix event listeners added in v1.1.1 to be compatible with Node.js < v10.
- Downgrade `node-fetch` to fix `--experimental-modules` tests for Node.js < v10.2.0 (see [bitinn/node-fetch#502](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/issues/502)).

## 1.1.1

### Patch

- Updated dependencies.
- Updated package scripts and config for the new [`husky`](https://npm.im/husky) version.
- Silence the `http-errors deprecated non-error status code; use only 4xx or 5xx status codes` warnings that appear (due to [jshttp/http-errors#50](https://github.com/jshttp/http-errors/issues/50)) when there are GraphQL errors.
- Expanded the source into separate files for easier code navigation.
- Add a project logo.

## 1.1.0

### Minor

- Support [`graphql`](https://npm.im/graphql) v14.

### Patch

- Updated dependencies.
- Stopped using [`npm-run-all`](https://npm.im/npm-run-all) for package scripts.
- Configured Prettier to lint `.yml` files.
- Ensure the readme Travis build status badge only tracks `master` branch.
- Use [Badgen](https://badgen.net) for the readme npm version badge.

## 1.0.0

- Updated dependencies.
- Lint fixes following dependency updates.
- Use [`jsdoc-md`](https://npm.im/jsdoc-md) instead of [`documentation`](https://npm.im/documentation) to generate readme API docs.
- Removed a temporary workaround for [a fixed Babel CLI bug](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8077).
- Updated package description and tags.

## 0.3.1

- Updated dependencies.
- Simplified ESLint config with [`eslint-config-env`](https://npm.im/eslint-config-env).

## 0.3.0

- Corrected an `errorHandler` middleware example in the readme.
- Refactored package scripts to use `prepare` to support installation via Git (e.g. `npm install jaydenseric/graphql-api-koa`).
- Compact package `repository` field.

## 0.2.0

- Set Node.js support as v8.5+.
- Avoided using a Koa context response shortcut.
- Fixed test snapshot consistency between Node.js versions (see [tapjs/node-tap#450](https://github.com/tapjs/node-tap/issues/450)).
- Manually test error properties instead of using snapshots.
- Added `errorHandler` middleware tests.
- Readme badge changes to deal with [shields.io](https://shields.io) unreliability:
  - Used the more reliable build status badge provided by Travis and placed it first as it loads the quickest.
  - Removed the licence badge. The licence can be found in `package.json` and rarely changes.
  - Removed the Github issues and stars badges. The readme is most viewed on Github anyway.
- Improved documentation.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release.
